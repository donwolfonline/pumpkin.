# 📣 Pumpkin v0.1 Launch Announcement

## 1. Core Message

**"Pumpkin is a programming language designed to be read, not just run."**

---

## 2. Main Announcement (Blog / GitHub Release)

**Title:** Introducing Pumpkin: A Programming Language for Humans

Today we are releasing the first public preview (v0.1) of **Pumpkin**.

**Why Pumpkin?**
Most programming languages are built for power and speed. They are tools for building complex systems. But for a beginner, those tools can feel scary. Cryptic symbols, confusing error messages, and complex setups build a wall between "I want to code" and "I am coding".

Pumpkin is different. It is built for **clarity**.
It removes the syntax noise so you can focus on the logic.

**Who is this for?**

* **Beginners** who feel overwhelmed by Python or JavaScript.
* **Teachers** who want to explain logic without explaining syntax rules.
* **Curious Minds** who want to play with code in a safe environment.

**What is in v0.1?**
This is a "preview" release. It includes:

* ✅ **Core Syntax**: Variables, Loops, Functions, and Logic.
* ✅ **Friendly Errors**: Messages that explain *why* and *how* to fix things.
* ✅ **Web Playground**: Try it instantly in your browser.
* ✅ **Standard Library v1**: Basic Math, Text, and List tools.

**What is NOT in v0.1 (Yet)?**
To keep expectations honest:

* ❌ File I/O (You cannot read/write files on disk yet).
* ❌ Package Manager (No external libraries).
* ❌ High Performance (Speed is not the goal right now).

**How to try it**
You can write your first program right now at [pumpkin.org](https://pumpkin.org).
Or verify the code on GitHub: [github.com/pumpkin-lang/pumpkin](https://github.com/pumpkin-lang/pumpkin)

We would love to hear what you think. If you find a bug (you will!), please let us know.

**Tweet 1/5:**
Introducing Pumpkin (v0.1) 🎃
A new programming language designed for humans, not robots.
If you've ever felt intimidated by code, this is for you.

**Tweet 2/5:**
Why? Because syntax shouldn't be a gatekeeper.
Pumpkin removes the semicolons, brackets, and confusing jargon.
It feels like reading English.

**Tweet 3/5:**
The best feature? Our Error Messages.
They don't blame you ("Illegal Operation").
They guide you ("We didn't expect this, try this instead").

**Tweet 4/5:**
This is v0.1. It's a preview.
It has loops, logic, and functions.
It doesn't have file I/O or big libraries yet.
We are optimizing for *trust*, not features.

**Tweet 5/5:**
Give it a spin in your browser (no install needed).

Let us know what you build! 🎃

### 👽 Reddit (r/programming, r/learnprogramming)

**Title:** I built a programming language with no "Syntax Errors" (Pumpkin v0.1)

**Body:**
Hi everyone,
I've spent the last few months building **Pumpkin**, a toy language designed purely for teachability.

**The Problem:**
When I teach friends to code, 90% of the friction is syntax. Use a colon? Use a brace? Why is `void` there? They lose the logic because they are fighting the parser.

**The Solution:**
Pumpkin is my attempt to fix this. It prioritizes readability over everything else.

* It looks like English (`repeat 3 times`).
* Errors are conversational ("I don't understand this line").
* There is zero setup.

**Honest Note:**
This is v0.1. It is an interpreter written in TypeScript. It is not fast. It is not for production. It is for *learning*.

**Try it:**

I'd love your feedback on the syntax choices!

### 🍊 Hacker News

**Title:** Pumpkin: A language designed for teachability

**Body:**
(Keep it very short. HN readers prefer looking at the code.)

I built a small interpreted language focused on friendly error messages and English-like syntax.
It's written in TypeScript/Ohm.js.
It prioritizes "Least Surprise" for non-programmers.
