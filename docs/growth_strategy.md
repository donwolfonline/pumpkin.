# 🌱 Pumpkin Open-Source Growth Strategy

## Strategic Goal

Grow a healthy, inclusive community of beginners and mentors. Optimization for **kindness** over hype.

---

## 1. Launch Phase (0-3 Months)

**Goal**: Get the first 100 passionate users who love the mission.

### Initial Audience

1. **Code Newbies**: People who failed to learn JS/Python.
2. **Educators**: Teachers looking for better tools.
3. **Mentors**: Experienced devs who want to help beginners.

### Channels & Tactics

* **GitHub**: "Show HN" style repo launch. Optimize README for clarity, not tech specs.
* **Twitter/X**: Share "Before vs After" code snippets. (e.g. "Python SyntaxError" vs "Pumpkin Friendly Error").
* **Dev.to / Hashnode**: Write detailed tutorials: "I built a programming language for people who hate programming."
* **Discord**: Soft launch a server for "Early Explorers".

### Success Metrics (First 90 Days)

* 100+ Stars on GitHub.
* 10+ Merged Pull Requests from strangers.
* 5+ "I wrote my first program" testimonials.

## 2. Community Building

**Philosophy**: Every interaction is a teaching moment.

### Contribution Guidelines

* **Labeling**: Use `good-first-issue` and `documentation-only` liberally.
* **Mentorship**: Maintainers commit to guiding first-time contributors through the PR process.
* **Recognition**: "Contributor Spotlight" in release notes for non-code contributions (docs, design).

### Feedback Loops

* **Monthly "Town Hall"**: Open voice chat for roadmap discussions.
* **"What Got You Stuck?"**: Automated follow-up for new users (if email captured) asking about their first 10 minutes.

---

## 3. Content Strategy

**Mantra**: Teach concepts, not just syntax.

### Types of Content

1. **"Zero to Hero" Tutorials**: text-based lessons that mimic the Curriculum levels.
2. **"Unlearning" Articles**: Addressing common misconceptions (e.g. "Programming is just math").
3. **Project Showcases**: Highlight weird/fun things built with Pumpkin.

### Example Blog Titles

* "Why we banned the semicolon."
* "How Pumpkin error messages are written like emails from a friend."
* "Building a Guessing Game in 10 lines of code."

---

## 4. Governance & Sustainability

**Model**: Benevolent Dictator for Now (BDFN) -> Steering Committee.

### Roles

* **Core Maintainers**: Merge access. Responsible for release quality.
* **Community Guides**: Moderation access. Responsible for Discord vibes.
* **Explorers**: Regular contributors.

### Avoiding Burnout

* **"No" is okay**: We will reject features that make the language too complex.
* **Slowing Down**: It's better to release slowly than to burn out the maintainers.
* **Automate kindness**: Use bots to welcome new contributors and check for CoC compliance.

---

## 5. Metrics that Matter

* **Retention**: do beginners come back for "Level 2"?
* **Kindness Score**: Qualitative tracking of Discord sentiment.
* **Documentation Hits**: Are people reading the guide?
* (Ignore: Vanity metrics like total downloads if retention is low).
