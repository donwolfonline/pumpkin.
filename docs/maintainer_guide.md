# 👩‍🌾 Pumpkin Maintainer Guide

Welcome to the team. If you are reading this, you have shown yourself to be a kind, thoughtful, and skilled contributor. Thank you.

## 1. The Philosophy

**"Maintainers are gardeners, not gatekeepers."**

Our job is not to say "No". Our job is to:

1. **Water the plants**: Encourage new contributors.
2. **Prune the vines**: Guide code to fit the vision.
3. **Keep the path clear**: Remove toxicity and confusion.

We optimize for **Contributor Happiness** over Code Perfection.

## 2. Responsibilities

### 🛡️ Triage (The Front Line)

* **Goal**: Every issue gets a meaningful reply within 48 hours.
* **Action**: Tag issues (`bug`, `good first issue`, `proposal`).
* **Tone**: "Thanks for finding this!" (Even if it's a duplicate).

### 📝 Code Review (The Classroom)

Reviewing code is teaching.

* **Be explicit with praise**: "This logic is really clean."
* **Ask, don't demand**: "Have you considered..." vs "Change this."
* **Explain the 'Why'**: If you reject something, explain the long-term vision reason.

### 🚀 Releases

* We aim for a monthly release cadence.
* Releases are managed via the GitHub Action workflow (see `RELEASE.md`).
* **Rule**: No breaking changes in minor versions (v0.x.0).

---

## 3. Decision Making

* **Small Decisions** (Refactors, bug fixes): You have full authority. Merge when ready.
* **Medium Decisions** (New standard library function): Require approval from 1 other Maintainer.
* **Large Decisions** (Syntax changes): Must be proposed as an Issue and approved by the BDFN (Founder).

## 4. Handling Conflict

Sometimes things get heated.

1. **De-escalate**: "Let's take a break and come back to this tomorrow."
2. **Private Check-in**: DM the person. Often frustration comes from feeling unheard.
3. **Enforce Boundaries**: If someone violates the Code of Conduct (insults, harassment), warn them immediately. We prioritize safety over code.

## 5. Your Health

* **It's okay to step away**: Open Source is a marathon. If you need a week (or month) off, just let us know.
* **No guilt**: You are a volunteer. You owe the project nothing but your kindness.

Thank you for tending the patch with us. 🎃
