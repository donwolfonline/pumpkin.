# Pumpkin v0.2 Release Notes

**Date:** January 5, 2026
**Version:** v0.2.0 ("The Runtime Update")

## Overview

Pumpkin v0.2 marks the transition from a prototype AST interpreter to a production-grade **Bytecode Virtual Machine**. This release introduces significant performance improvements, a robust module system, user-defined functions, and first-class arrays.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Bytecode VM

* **Performance:** Replaced the tree-walking interpreter with a stack-based Bytecode VM.
* **Architecture:** Flat bytecode chunks, constant pool, and operand stack.
* **Safety:** Panic-free execution with managed stack overflow and division-by-zero checks.

### 📦 Module System

* **Imports:** `import "module_name"` syntax to load dependencies.
* **Exports:** `export let` and `export function` to expose symbols.
* **Isolation:** Each module runs in its own scope.
* **Caching:** Modules are executed once and cached.

### 🛠 Functions

* **User-Defined:** Define functions with `function name(arg1, arg2) { ... }`.
* **Recursion:** Full support for recursive calls.
* **First-Class:** Functions can be stored in variables and passed as arguments.

### 🧊 Arrays

* **Literals:** Create arrays with `[1, 2, 3]`.
* **Indexing:** Access elements with `arr[index]`.
* **Bounds Checking:** Runtime protection against out-of-bounds access.

### 🐞 Debugger API

* **Protocol:** Standardized JSON protocol for IDE integration.
* **Control:** Step-into, Step-over, Breakpoints, and Pause support.
* **Inspection:** View stack trace and variable state.

## Breaking Changes from v0.1

* **Execution Model:** Scripts are now compiled before execution. Syntax errors are caught earlier.
* **Variables:** "Global" variables in a module are now scoped to that module, not the entire program.

## Known Limitations

* No standard library (e.g., file I/O) in the core VM yet.
* Debugging symbol maps maps instruction pointers to lines, but not yet column numbers.
* Strings are immutable; string concatenation creates new allocations (though optimized with Rc).
