## 2. What Is Pumpkin?

Pumpkin is a programming language built for humans, not robots.

Most languages feel like specialized codes written for machines. Pumpkin feels like English. It removes the scary symbols and confusing jargon, replacing them with clear instructions that make sense the first time you read them.

It's not just a toy—it's a real tool for automating tasks, solving problems, and learning how computers think.

## 3. Why Pumpkin Exists

Learning to code is hard enough without having to memorize where every semicolon goes.

For too long, beginners have been discouraged by cryptic error messages and steep learning curves. We believe that coding is a creative superpower that should be accessible to everyone.

We built Pumpkin to be the bridge. It gives you the power of programming without the pain of setting up a complex environment or debugging invisible syntax errors.

## 4. How Pumpkin Feels

**Thinking in Symbols (Others):**

```javascript
const x = readline();
if (x != null && x > 10) {
  console.log("Success");
}
```

**Thinking in Pumpkin:**

```pumpkin
ask "Enter a number" into x

if x > 10 {
    show "Success"
}
```

Pumpkin lets you focus on *logic*, not punctuation.
