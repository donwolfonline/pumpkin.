# 🌱 Pumpkin: First 100 Users Strategy

## The Goal

Acquire 100 **engaged** users who:

1. Run at least one Pumpkin program.
2. Talk to us (give feedback).
3. Feel smarter than when they started.

**Metric for Success**: 100 "Aha!" moments, not just 100 downloads.

## 1. Where to Find Them (The Channels)

### A. The "Does This Make Sense?" Cohort (Personal Network)

* **Who**: Non-technical friends, designers, marketers, family members.
* **Action**: DM them directly. "I built a programming language that works like English. Can you try to write a 'shopping list' program in 5 minutes? I'll watch."
* **Goal**: 10 Users. (High feedback, low volume).

### B. The Frustrated Learners (Reddit & Discord)

* **Who**: People stuck on "Syntax Errors" in Python/JS.
* **Where**: `r/learnprogramming`, `r/webdev`, `r/nocode`.
* **Action**: Look for posts saying "Programming is too hard." Reply kindly: "I built a tiny language specifically to solve this frustration. It's called Pumpkin. Want to try it?"
* **Goal**: 40 Users.

### C. The Curious Tinkerers (Twitter/X & Mastodon)

* **Who**: Developers who like DSLs and "Cozy Web" tools.
* **Action**: Post "Before/After" screenshots. "Here is how you ask for a name in Python vs Pumpkin."
* **Goal**: 50 Users.

## 2. The 10-Minute Onboarding Promise

We must get them to a "Win" in under 10 minutes, or they are gone.

1. **Minute 1**: Land on Homepage. Read "The language you can actually read."
2. **Minute 2**: Click "Playground".
3. **Minute 3**: Run the pre-loaded "Hello World". (Win #1).
4. **Minute 5**: Modify it to say their own name. (Win #2).
5. **Minute 10**: Share their code with a friend using the "Share" button.

## 3. Weekly Action Plan

### Week 1: Direct Sales (Do things that don't scale)

* **Monday**: DM 5 friends. "Can I borrow 10 minutes?"
* **Wednesday**: Watch 3 people use it over Zoom. Take notes on where they squint.
* **Friday**: Fix the top 3 confusing things found in user tests.

### Week 2: Targeted Communities

* **Monday**: Find 5 "I gave up on coding" threads on Reddit. Write thoughtful, non-spammy replies.
* **Wednesday**: Post to `r/sideproject`: "I made a programming language for my non-tech friends."
* **Friday**: Welcome every new Discord member personally.

### Week 3: Content Marketing

* **Monday**: Write a blog post: "Why I removed the semicolon."
* **Wednesday**: Tweet thread: "ERROR MESSAGES SHOULD BE KIND." (Viral potential).
* **Friday**: Release v0.1.1 based on first feedback.

## 4. Converting Users to Contributors

* **The "Easy Win" Issue**: If a user finds a typo, ask them to fix it in the docs. "You can make your first Open Source contribution right now!"
* **The "Helper" Role**: If a user answers a question in Discord, give them a "Helper" badge immediately.
* **Public Thanks**: Shout out every contributor in the release notes.

## 5. Success Metrics (The "Kind" Metrics)

* ❌ **Vanity**: Total visits, Twitter impressions.
* ✅ **Real**:
  * Number of code snippets shared.
  * Number of replies in Discord saying "It works!".
  * Number of users who come back a second time.
