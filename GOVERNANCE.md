# 🎃 Pumpkin Governance Model

## 1. Our Values

1. **Kindness First**: We optimize for how the user *feels*. Technically correct but confusing is a bug.
2. **Stability**: We value the beginner's trust. We don't break their code lightly.
3. **Transparency**: We discuss major changes in the open.

## 2. Roles

### 🧑‍🌾 The Founder (Benevolent Dictator for Now - BDFN)

* **Role**: Sets the long-term vision and philosophy.
* **Responsibility**: Has the final say on language semantics and brand.
* **Why**: Pumpkin is an opinionated language. To keep it focused and simple, we need a single vision in the early stages.

### 👩‍🔧 Maintainers

* **Role**: Trusted community members who triage issues, review PRs, and manage releases.
* **Responsibility**: Ensuring the codebase stays healthy and contributors feel welcome.
* **Selection**: Contributors who show consistent quality and kindness are invited to become Maintainers.

### 🐝 Contributors

* **Role**: Everyone who files an issue, fixes a typo, or writes code.
* **Responsibility**: Follow the Code of Conduct and help make Pumpkin better.

## 3. Decision Making

* **Consensus Seeking**: We try to reach agreement through discussion on GitHub Issues.
* **Tie-Breaking**: If consensus cannot be reached, the Founder makes the final decision to keep the project moving.

## 4. How to Propose Changes (The "Pumpkin Proposal" Process)

We want your ideas! But because Pumpkin is a language, changes can break things.

1. **Small Changes** (Typos, bugs, docs): Just open a Pull Request.
2. **Big Changes** (New syntax, new keywords):
    * **Open a Discussion**: Start a GitHub Issue titled `[Proposal] Your Idea`.
    * **Discuss**: We will talk about the pros and cons.
    * **Wait**: Do not write code until the proposal is accepted. We don't want you to waste your time!

## 5. Conflict Resolution

If a disagreement gets heated:

1. **Pause**: Step away from the keyboard.
2. **Assume Good Intent**: Remember we all want Pumpkin to succeed.
3. **Escalate**: If needed, contact the Maintainers or Founder privately. We enforce our Code of Conduct strictly against harassment.

## 6. Long-Term Stewardship

Pumpkin is open source (MIT License). It belongs to the community.
While the Founder leads effectively, they stay in charge. If the Founder steps away, a Steering Committee of Maintainers will be formed to lead the project.
