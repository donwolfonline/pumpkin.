# 🌱 Pumpkin Contributor Mentorship Program

## Purpose

To help beginners contribute safely and grow into long-term maintainers.
**Rule**: We optimize for *confidence*, not speed.

---

## 1. Who is this for?

* **Mentees**: Anyone who has never contributed to open source before, or who feels intimidated by a language codebase. We welcome learners.
* **Mentors**: Experienced contributors who enjoy teaching more than they enjoy coding.

## 2. Program Structure: "The Buddy System"

This is a lightweight, asynchronous program. No strict schedules.

### How to Join

1. **Find an Issue**: Look for issues tagged `mentor-available`.
2. **Claim it**: Comment "I'd like to work on this with a mentor."
3. **Match**: A Maintainer assigns the issue to you and introduces you to your Mentor in the comment thread.

## 3. Expectations

### 🧑‍🎓 Mentees

* **Ask Questions**: There are no "stupid" questions. If you are stuck for >30 minutes, ask.
* **Be Patient**: Mentors are volunteers. They may take a day or two to reply.
* **Communicate**: If you get busy and can't finish, just let us know. It's totally okay!

### 🧙‍♂️ Mentors

* **Guide, Don't Drive**: Don't provide the code solution. Provide hints, links to docs, or pseudo-code.
* **Review Kindly**: Use the "Sandwich Method" (Praise, Suggestion, Praise).
* **Celebrate**: When the PR is merged, hype them up!

## 4. Suggested First Contributions

We curate special issues for this program:

1. **Documentation**: Fixing typos, explaining a confusing error message better.
2. **Tests**: Adding a new test case for a bug that was already fixed.
3. **Standard Library**: Adding a simple helper function (e.g., `list.reverse()`).

---

## 5. The Growth Path

1. **First PR**: You get the "Contributor" badge and a shout-out in the release notes.
2. **3 Merged PRs**: You are invited to the "Triage Team" to help label issues.
3. **consistent Help**: You may be invited to become a Mentor or Maintainer.

## 6. Success Indicators

* ✅ Mentee submits a PR (even if it needs changes).
* ✅ Mentee returns to open a second issue.
* ✅ Mentee feels "smart" and "welcome" (measured by feedback).
