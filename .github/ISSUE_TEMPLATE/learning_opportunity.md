## 🎓 Learning Goal

This task is designed to teach you about:

- [ ] How the Standard Library works

We need to implement a helper function: `...`

For example:

# What the user should be able to write
```

## 🗺️ How to Solve It

1. Open `src/stdlib/index.ts`.
2. Find the `Math` module object.
3. Add a new property:

    ```typescript
    'newFunc': { type: 'native_func', call: (args) => ... }
    ```

4. Run `npm test` to verify.
