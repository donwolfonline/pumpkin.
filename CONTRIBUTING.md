# Contributing to Pumpkin 🎃

Hi there! We are thrilled that you want to help build Pumpkin.

Our mission is to make programming **friendly** and **accessible** to everyone. By contributing, you are helping lower the barrier to entry for the next generation of coders.

## 💖 Our Values

1. **Inclusivity**: Everyone belongs here. No question is "too stupid."
2. **Kindness**: We treat each other with respect. Code reviews are for learning, not gatekeeping.
3. **Clarity**: We prefer clear code over clever code.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct

We adopt the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). In short: **Be nice.** Harassment or unwelcoming behavior is not tolerated.

## 🚀 How to Contribute

### Everyone Can Help

You don't need to be a compiler expert. You can help by:

* **Fixing Typos**: Found a spelling mistake in our docs? Fix it!
* **Writing Examples**: Create new simple programs for the `examples/` folder.
* **Reporting Bugs**: Did Pumpkin crash? Tell us *how* it happened so we can fix it.
* **Improving Errors**: Can an error message be friendlier? Suggest a change!

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone** your fork to your computer.
3. **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
4. **Make Changes**: Write your code or docs.
5. **Test**: Run existing examples to make sure nothing broke.
    * `node src/run.js examples/calculator.pumpkin`
6. **Push**: `git push origin my-new-feature`
7. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the main Pumpkin repo and click "New Pull Request".

### Style Guidelines

* **TypeScript**: We use strict typing. No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
* **Formatting**: Keep lines clean. Run a linter if available.
* **Commit Messages**: Be descriptive.
  * ✅ `Fix: Correct spelling in hello_world example`
  * ❌ `fixed stuff`

## 💡 Proposing Changes

Have a big idea? (Like adding a new loop type or changing syntax).
Please **open an issue first** to discuss it. We want to make sure it fits with the "Beginner-First" philosophy before you spend hours coding it.

Thank you for making Pumpkin better! 🎃
