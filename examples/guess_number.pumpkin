# Guess the Number Game
# We use a 'while' loop to keep asking until the guess is correct.

let secret = 7
let guess = 0

show "I am thinking of a number."

while guess != secret {
    ask "Guess the number:" into inputVal
    guess = inputVal
    
    if guess == secret {
        show "You got it! 🎉"
    } else {
        show "Try again."
    }
}
