# ⏱️ Your First 10 Minutes with Pumpkin

Welcome! If you have never written a line of code in your life, you are in the right place.
We promise: No scary math, no confusing jargon. Just 10 minutes to feel like a wizard.

---

## Minute 0–1: What is this? 🎃

Pumpkin is a language designed for humans, not machines.
Most coding languages look like this: `System.out.println("Hello");`
Pumpkin looks like this: `show "Hello"`

We removed the scary symbols so you can focus on the logic. Let's start!

---

## Minute 1–3: Your First Spell ✨

1. Open the **Pumpkin Playground**.
2. Type this exactly:

```pumpkin
show "Hello, World!"
```

1. Click the **Run 🚀** button.
2. See the text appear on the right?

**Congratulations!** You just wrote code. You gave the computer a command ("show this text"), and it obeyed you. That's all programming is.

---

## Minute 3–5: Make It Yours 🎨

Let's change the command. Computers are great at repeating things.

1. Delete the old code.
2. Type this:

```pumpkin
repeat 3 times {
    show "I am coding!"
}
```

1. Click **Run**.
2. Do you see the message three times?

**Try this:** Change `3` to `100`. Change `"I am coding!"` to your name.
(Don't worry, you can't break it!)

## Minute 5–7: Remembering Things (Variables) 🧠

A computer has a great memory. We can ask it to remember a name for us. We call this a "Variable" (like a labeled box).

1. Type this:

```pumpkin
let name = "Pumpkin"
show name
```

1. Click **Run**. It shows "Pumpkin".
2. Now, let's make it smarter. Let's ask *you* for the name.

```pumpkin
ask "What is your name?" into name
show "Nice to meet you,"
show name
```

1. Click **Run**. Type your name when asked!

---

## Minute 7–9: Making Decisions 🚦

This is the most powerful part of coding: The **If** statement. It lets the computer think.

1. Type this:

```pumpkin
ask "What is the secret magic word?" into word

if word is "please" {
    show "Access Granted! 🔓"
} else {
    show "Access Denied. 🔒"
}
```

1. Click **Run**. Try typing "please".
2. Click **Run** again. Try typing "abracadabra".

See how the computer reacts differently? You just taught it logic!

---

## Minute 9–10: What Now? 🚀

You just learned:

* ✅ **Commands** (`show`)
* ✅ **Loops** (`repeat`)
* ✅ **Memory** (`let`)
* ✅ **Input** (`ask`)
* ✅ **Logic** (`if`)

You have the basics! Here is what you can try next:

* Make a **Calculator** that adds two numbers.
* Make a **Guess the Number** game.
* Check out the **Examples** menu for inspiration.

**Welcome to the Patch! 🎃**
