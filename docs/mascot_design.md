# 🎃 Pumpkin Mascot Design Guide

## 1. Character Bio

* **Name**: "Pump" (or just "The Pumpkin").
* **Role**: Your friendly coding companion.
* **Personality**: Pump is the supportive friend who sits next to you while you code. Pump is never judgmental, never sarcastic, and always calm. Pump loves logic puzzles and seeing humans create things.
* **Vibe**: Think "Baymax" meets "Totoro" but as a small pumpkin. Soft, round, and safe.

## 2. Visual Style Guidelines

* **Shape**: Perfectly round or slightly squat pumpkin. Soft edges, no sharp angles.
* **Color**: Vibrant Pumpkin Orange (`#FF7518`) with a vibrant green stem (`#3B8132`).
* **Face**: Simple features. Large, wondering eyes (dots or ovals). A tiny, content smile. No nose.
* **Limbs**: Optional. If present, they are nub-like and minimal (like a plush toy).
* **Texture**: Smooth, matte finish. Not realistic/gritty. 3D rendered style (claymorphism or soft plastic).

## 3. Expressions & Use Cases

### 😊 Happy (Success)

* **Context**: Code runs successfully, user finishes a lesson.
* **Visual**: Eyes squinting in joy, little sparkles around the head, maybe a small bounce.
* **Message**: "You did it! That was magic."

### 🤔 Thinking (Processing)

* **Context**: Code is running, or user is typing.
* **Visual**: One eye slightly larger, stem tilted to the side, looking up.
* **Message**: "Hmm, interesting..."

### ❤️ Encouraging (Error)

* **Context**: Syntax error or bug.
* **Visual**: Holding a sign or pointing gently. Concerned but calm eyes. NOT dead/X-eyes.

### 🎉 Celebrating (Milestone)

* **Context**: First "Hello World", completing a level.
* **Visual**: Confetti, jumping in the air, holding a star.
* **Message**: "Welcome to the world of coding!"

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

* ✅ **Do**: Make eyes the main expressive feature.
* ✅ **Do**: Keep the design simple enough to be an emoji/icon.
* ❌ **Don't**: Give it scary jack-o'-lantern teeth.
* ❌ **Don't**: Use "Halloween" horror tropes (blood, cobwebs).
* ❌ **Don't**: Give it realistic human hands or feet.
