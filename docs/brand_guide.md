# 🎃 Pumpkin Brand Guide

## 1. Brand Story

**Why Pumpkin exists:**
Programming has become exclusive. It's full of jargon, cryptic errors, and complex setups that scare away curious minds. We believe that coding is a creative superpower that should be accessible to everyone—not just engineers.

**The Problem:**
"I want to learn to code, but it looks too hard."

**The Solution:**
Pumpkin is a language designed to be *read*. It removes the scary parts (semicolons, braces, cryptic errors) and replaces them with friendly, human-readable instructions.

## 2. Taglines

**Primary:**
> "Code for Humans, Not Robots."

**Secondary:**
> "The friendly way to learn programming."
> "Start coding in 5 minutes. No magic required."

## 3. Tone of Voice

**Personality:**
We are the friendly teacher who sits next to you. We are patient, encouraging, and clear. We are intelligent, but never show off.

**Writing Rules:**

* ✅ **Do:** Use simple words. Say "Show" instead of "Print", "Ask" instead of "Input".
* ✅ **Do:** Be encouraging. Use emojis (`🎃`, `✨`, `🚀`) to lighten the mood.
* ✅ **Do:** Explain "Why". Always give context.
* ❌ **Don't:** Use jargon like "stdout", "stdin", "instantiate", or "compile" without explanation.
* ❌ **Don't:** Be condescending. Never say "It's easy" or "Just do this".
* ❌ **Don't:** Blame the user. It's not "Invalid Input", it's "We didn't understand that".

## 4. Visual Identity

### Color Palette

* **Pumpkin Orange** (`#FF7518`): Primary brand color. Warm and energetic.
* **Vine Green** (`#3B8132`): Success messages, growth, correct code.
* **Night Sky** (`#1A1A2E`): Backgrounds for code snippets. High contrast.
* **Starlight** (`#FEF9E7`): Text color. Soft on the eyes.

### Typography

* **Headings**: Clean, rounded sans-serif (e.g., *Nunito* or *Quicksand*).
* **Body**: Readable sans-serif (e.g., *Inter* or *Open Sans*).
* **Code**: Monospace with character (e.g., *Fira Code* or *JetBrains Mono*).

### Emoji Usage

Emojis are part of our syntax and our brand. Use them to denote status:

* 🎃 : The Pumpkin assistant / Brand logo.
* ✨ : Success / Magic.
* 🚀 : Running code / Progress.
* 🐛 : Bugs (but cute ones).

## 5. Public Messaging

### Homepage Hero

**Headline**: The Programming Language You Can Read.
**Subhead**: Stop wrestling with syntax. Start building ideas. Pumpkin is the beginner-friendly language that teaches you as you type.

### "Why Pumpkin?" (Comparison)

* **Python**: Great, but indentation errors are tricky for beginners.
* **JavaScript**: Powerful, but too many confusing symbols (`{}`, `[]`, `=>`, `;`).
* **Pumpkin**: No indentation rules. English keywords. Helpful errors.

## 6. Community Values

1. **Inclusivity**: Everyone belongs here. No question is "too stupid".
2. **Learning over Ego**: We celebrate mistakes because they mean we are learning.
3. **Kind Feedback**: If you correct someone, do it with kindness and offer a solution.
